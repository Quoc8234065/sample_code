# Silent Verification API - Wi-Fi override (Android)

Use this Java/Kotlin sample code to help you implement a Wi-Fi override feature in the Android app you are integrating with the Telesign Silent Verification API. This is a necessary part of your integration, because verification using this service only works when the requests are made using a mobile network connection.
